@Minor Update Ping 
Apprently odyssey's rewards were bugged for when you cashed out. Normally, 
every 100 intensity is an extra reward (either 100 gems or any of the shards), 
with you starting off at 3 draws. This was bugged and the amount of draws youd 
have reset every room, effectively locking you to 1-2. This was fixed and you 
now properly get more rewards and can get Elemental and Phoenix shards much faster
Fixed not receiving any end reward when losing in Odyssey. Losing is supposed 
to cash out 6 less than your current draws
Fixed being able to retry when losing in Odyssey

Receiving the shards from a cashout might not display, but if you check your 
inventory you will see that you did indeed gain the shards

Enjoy the reworked Odyssey mode, sorry for the issues this update but it shouldn't 
happen again, I just finished moving in, although my arrangement is still a bit 
sketch rn ðŸ¥¶
