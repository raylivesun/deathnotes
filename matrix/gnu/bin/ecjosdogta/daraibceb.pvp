We've made a variety of changes to the server to make it a better 
experience for all of our international users, including two brand-new 
channels:
⁠「📜」int-rules where you can find all the translated rules, alongside 
which moderators currently operate in which international channels.
⁠「📣」int-announcements where all relevant international announcements 
will be held, including polls, server changes, translated announcements 
(including the ones above which have already been translated), and more!
To view these channels, you require one of our International Speaker roles 
which you can obtain here: ⁠Channels & Roles

While we currently support only Russian, Spanish, Portuguese and Filipino 
channels, we are looking to potentially expand this list further. You can 
show your enthusiasm for any channel you would like to see in AV by making 
a suggestion/supporting an already existing one in ⁠「💡」suggestions !
