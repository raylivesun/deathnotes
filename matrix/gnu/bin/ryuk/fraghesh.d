/**
###  AwoTech for Sale
-# your partner for ro-aviation!

After careful consideration, I have made 
the difficult decision to place AwoTech up 
for sale. As one of my most recent ventures, 
this project has been especially meaningful 
to me. However, due to current time constraints 
and the level of active involvement AwoTech 
requires to thrive, I am unable to continue 
giving it the full attention it deserves.

This decision was not made lightly, and I am 
hopeful that AwoTech will find a new owner 
who can continue to develop and grow its 
potential.
