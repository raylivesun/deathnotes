VE Day - 80th Anniversary ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
To those of you who are residents of Commonwealth Nations, Great Britain and the Allied Forces, today marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. 

80 Years on since the end of World War 2, we remember those who gave their lives in serving our nation and protecting us from the tyranny and violence of the Axis Forces. The Veterans who are still with us today, will likely no longer be with us when we celebrate another Anniversary of VE Day, so in honour of them and their fallen comrades, we celebrate every single one of them.

80 Years ago today, the streets in every city were full of people partying, getting drunk, enjoying every second that was the first hours of peace in years. To quote Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister at the time, "This is your Victory."

I hope everyone has had a good week of celebrations and you will enjoy the rest of the ongoing celebrations.

All the best,
Charlie
